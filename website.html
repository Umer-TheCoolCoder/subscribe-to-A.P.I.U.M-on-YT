<h1>His channel<h1>

<p>A regular (nerd) boy decided that his new year resolution for 2025 was to own a channel, and believe it or not, in Jan 2, that's exactly what he did. he quickly made his first video in Jan 20, 6:50 pm. his videos mostly consist of eductional videos, but at the same time, he makes viral car to robot transformation in his shorts. At the time this webpage is being created, he has 106 subscribers, and all it took for him was 3 months. This webpage was created by the creator of the channel: "A. P. I. U. M." short for A Peek In Umer's Mind. if your seeing this, PLEASE, subscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@APeekInUmersMind       thx      peace      :)     bye!!!</p>
